# hello-world
The goal of this repository is for me to learn how to use Github so that I know what I'm doing as I start uploading projects of my own!
My name is Rafael, I am in the process of learning how to code with the goal of getting my first job as an IT professional. For the past months, I have been learning how to code in HTML, CSS and Java Script, and also the Bootstrap library. I live in Brazil, in the state of Minas Gerais, with my cats. I currently work as a sales agent for a call center company.
